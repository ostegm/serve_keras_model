# Demo: Train a Keras Model and Serve Locally with Tensorflow Serving

In this example, I show how to build a simple keras model, convert it to a TF Estimator, train, evaluate and export a saved model. Then using the saved model, we launch tensorflow serving and make requests.

## Prerequisites:
- Python2.7 w/ Tensorflow >=1.7, Pandas, requests
- Docker installed locally
